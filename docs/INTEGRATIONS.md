# Integrations: mailbox, calendar and webhooks (Phase 3)

## What is built

| Integration | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google (Gmail read and send, Google Calendar read) | **Implemented, tested against a local fixture of the Google APIs.** Not yet tested against Google with real credentials. | Needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| Microsoft 365 (Outlook inbox read and send, calendar read via Microsoft Graph) | **Implemented, tested against a local fixture of Microsoft Graph.** Not yet tested against Microsoft with real credentials. | Needs `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, optional `MICROSOFT_TENANT` |
| Outbound webhooks | Implemented and tested end to end (signing, retries, auto-disable, redelivery) | No credentials needed |
| Slack, Teams, Zoom, Twilio, WhatsApp, Stripe, Razorpay, DocuSign, Zapier | Not built | Shown as "Not available yet" in the app |

Without credentials the Integrations page says which variables are missing and offers no Connect button.

## Setting up Google

1. In Google Cloud Console create an OAuth client of type "Web application".
2. Authorised redirect URI: `<PUBLIC_WEB_URL>/api/v1/integrations/google/callback`.
3. Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API. Scopes requested: `openid`, `email`, `gmail.readonly`,
   `gmail.send`, `calendar.readonly`.
4. Gmail read scopes are restricted scopes: a public launch needs Google's OAuth verification and,
   for restricted scopes, a security assessment. Until then the app works only for test users you add.
5. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `PUBLIC_WEB_URL`.

## Setting up Microsoft 365

1. In Microsoft Entra ID register an application (web platform).
2. Redirect URI: `<PUBLIC_WEB_URL>/api/v1/integrations/microsoft/callback`.
3. Delegated permissions: `offline_access`, `openid`, `email`, `User.Read`, `Mail.Read`, `Mail.Send`,
   `Calendars.Read`. Some organisations require admin consent.
4. Create a client secret. Set `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `MICROSOFT_TENANT`
   (`common` for multi-tenant, or a directory id).

## Behaviour

- Each member connects their own account (permission `activities:write`). OAuth `state` is signed and
  bound to the signed-in user and workspace; it expires after 10 minutes.
- Tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (required in production). Disconnecting
  deletes the stored tokens; synced emails and meetings stay on their records.
- Sync runs every 15 minutes per connection (and on "Sync now"). Only messages and events that involve
  an existing contact or lead are stored. The first sync looks back 30 days (up to 200 Gmail messages);
  calendar covers the past 30 and next 60 days.
- Microsoft sync reads the Inbox only. Mail sent from DealFlow is recorded when sent; mail sent from
  Outlook directly is not imported yet.
- A revoked or expired sign-in marks the connection "Needs attention", stops scheduled syncs and notifies
  the person. After 5 consecutive other failures the connection is also paused.
- Sending: one recipient per message, from the sender's own mailbox, at most `EMAIL_DAILY_SEND_LIMIT`
  (default 200) per person per 24 hours. Headers are sanitised. A sent email is logged as an EMAIL
  activity on the matching contact or lead. DealFlow does not send bulk email.

## Webhooks

- Admins with `integrations:manage` add an https endpoint and choose events. The signing secret is shown
  once and stored encrypted.
- Body: `{ id, type, createdAt, data: { entityType, entityId, actorUserId, changes } }`. Headers:
  `X-DealFlow-Event`, `X-DealFlow-Delivery`, and `X-DealFlow-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` where
  `v1 = HMAC-SHA256(secret, "<t>.<raw body>")`. Reject timestamps older than a few minutes.
- At-least-once delivery. A non-2xx answer or timeout (10 s) retries after 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 2 h and
  6 h (`WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 6 attempts), then the delivery is marked failed and can be
  redelivered by hand. After `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_AFTER_FAILURES` (default 15) failures in a row the
  endpoint is switched off and admins are notified.
- Targets must be public https URLs. Private, loopback, link-local and metadata addresses are refused
  (checked at save time and before every delivery). Redirects are not followed. Known gap: a DNS
  rebinding between the check and the request is not prevented; pin resolved addresses before launch.

## Testing

`apps/api/test/fixtures/provider-fixture.ts` is a local HTTP server that mimics the Google and Graph
endpoints the adapters call. `apps/api/test/integrations.e2e.test.ts` runs the full OAuth round trip,
sync, send, reconnect-on-revoke and tenant isolation against it. Passing these tests shows our side of
the protocol is consistent with the documented API shapes; it does not prove the live providers accept
the app, which needs a run with real credentials.
